        <dt>Introduction</dt>
        <dd><p>This OER material is intended for use as the first level of web technology development. It focuses on the skills needed to build, maintain, and administrate a website. At the beginning of the courses, students will learn how to construct and test code in different interfaces such as HTML, CSS, and HTML5. After that, the course will teach students how to explore different libraries and frameworks, customize existing routines or procedures in their code, and leverage code from past projects to develop code for a new one. At the end, students will demonstrate their coding skills by translating design requirements and instructions into a responsive implementation using different interfaces and frameworks, and host their class work through the internet.
        </p>
        <p>The OER material is separated into four chapters. Each chapter has its learning outcomes, support materials, and some chapters have support videos. The support materials are downloadable and are in .pdf format, therefore before downloading the material you have to ensure that you have an application that can read the .pdf format</p>
        <p>The OER material also has activities on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap5. The activities are carried out as a complement to the learning of each chapter. Most of the activity have an activity description and an exemplary video.</p>
        <p>At the end of this OER website is the projects section. The projects are intended to test how students can link what they learned from the chapters and form a project. Each project has a description of the project, how the project will be graded, and samples of work done by previous students.</p>
      </dd>
        <dt>Curricular Objectives Addresses by This Course</dt>
        <dd><p> At the end of the course, student shall be able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build and test code using text editor, and translate design instruction into code.</li>
          <li>Translate design direction into a responsive implementation using different web development techniques such as HTML, CSS, HTML5, and bootstrap5.</li>
          <li>Collect and use existing routines or procedures and integrate them into their code.</li>
          <li>Customize frameworks, like a blueprint or a template, for their application.</li>
          <li>Display ingenuity and initiative to resolve difficulties while working on individual or team project.</li>
          <li>Deliver tasks on-time and match quality requirements.</li>
          <li>Carry his/her share of the team’s load and work with people with a variety of ideas and participate in a team culture.</li>

      <dd><p>I want to give my thanks to my mother Wanxia who has taught me to trust in myself, in my abilities, and in my dreams. As my mom says: <i>“always do with the best you can offer!”</i>
      <br><br>
      I also want to give thanks to the support of OER in QCC that helped me organize the necessary documentation for the publication of this manual.

          <h3>Hosting your website on a server</h3>
          In this article, I'll walk you through one way that you can take your webpage and host it on your own server. Why would you want that? And what's a "server" anyway? When you visit websites on the internet, they are each hosted by a "server". A server is a computer located somewhere in the world that's connected to the internet, and that computer's job is to "serve" webpages to internet users that want to view them.

          <h3>Hosting your website on Github</h3>
           Github is a company that hosts "code repositories", collections of code for projects. Many of the code repositories are "open source", which means they're publicly available for the whole world to browse. That's awesome, because that's how programmers learn from each other and build on each other's work! Khan Academy has quite a few open source repositories. Code repositories can contain all sorts of types of code, not just HTML and CSS - whatever code is needed to make the project work.
