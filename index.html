          This OER material is intended for use as the first level of web technology development.
          It focuses on the skills needed to build, maintain, and administrate a website. At the beginning of the courses, students will learn how to construct and test code in different interfaces such as HTML, CSS, and HTML5. After that, the course will teach students how to explore different libraries and frameworks, customize existing routines or procedures in their code, and leverage code from past projects to develop code for a new one. At the end, students will demonstrate their coding skills by translating design requirements and instructions into a responsive implementation using different interfaces and frameworks, and host their class work through the internet.

              <b>Using the browser developer tools</b><br><br>
              Web development is tricky. That's why web developers use lots of tools to help them with their jobs—and they're always looking for new tools to add to their toolbox.
              The browser developer tools which are included in most modern browsers are a big favorite of most developers. Each browser differs in exactly which tools they provide, but they're more similar than they are different.

              <b>Hosting your website on a server</b>
              <br><br>
              In this article, I'll walk you through one way that you can take your webpage and host it on your own server.
              Why would you want that? And what's a "server" anyway?
              When you visit websites on the internet, they are each hosted by a "server". A server is a computer located somewhere in the world that's connected to the internet, and that computer's job is to "serve" webpages to internet users that want to view them.
              <br><br>

              <br><br><hr>
              <b>Hosting your website on Github</b>
              <br><br>
              Github is a company that hosts "code repositories", collections of code for projects. Many of the code repositories are "open source", which means they're publicly available for the whole world to browse. That's awesome, because that's how programmers learn from each other and build on each other's work! Khan Academy has quite a few open source repositories. Code repositories can contain all sorts of types of code, not just HTML and CSS - whatever code is needed to make the project work.

      	<p>The Internet is part of nearly everything we do on a daily basis. But do you know how it all works? From WiFi to IP addresses to HTML to keeping information safe online, there’s a lot of important stuff going on that most of us don’t have the opportunity to learn more about. In six short, introductory videos, you’ll get an inside look into foundational concepts of everything from wires to websites, taught by guest lecturers including the actual “Father of the Internet” Vint Cerf, Tumblr founder David Karp, and creators on teams at Google, Spotify, XBox, Symantec, and more.</p>
